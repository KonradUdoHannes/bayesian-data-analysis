# Summary

* The following solutions were presented and discussed:

  * Exercise 1: Sven
  * Exercise 2: Amin
  * Exercise 5: Sven
  * Exercise 6: Vasa
  * Exercise 7: SÃ¶ren

* The following volunteered for next time:

  * Exercise 15: Aaron
  * Exercise 19: Salma
  * Exercise 20: Brian
  * Exercise 21: Corrie

* It was suggested that somebody present the details of one of the examples and Vasa volunteered to look into the cancer rate example for next time.

* Some exercises have boring details - it's up to the person presenting the solution what counts as boring.

* We agreed that biweekly is a good rhythm: weekly is too much to prepare for and less than biweekly leads to forgetting.

* We agreed to set up a slack poll to decide the day of the week to avoid selection bias of those present.
